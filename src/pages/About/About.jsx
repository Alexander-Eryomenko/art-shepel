            I'm an artist from Ukraine!
            I was born in Kharkiv. This city gave me a lot of knowledge and experience . At 2021 I have finished Kharkiv state Academy of Design and Arts.
            Now I am living in Germany. And right now Germany is like second home for me.  Unfortunately, I can't return home, but luckily I found my home in my heart. And I want to show you a peace of myself in my paintings!
